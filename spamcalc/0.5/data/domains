# domains
#
# This file contains a list of files with domain scores in them.
#
# Each domain can have a positive score, indication a higher possibility
# that a hostname ending within that domain is a spamhost, or a negative
# score, reducing the possibility that the hostname is spam.
#
# Useful for domains like home.com which have a very hiererarchical
# structure, and for domains that contain lots of spam hosts.

# You can define a subdir in which all the datafiles are stored here.
# Don't add a trailing / .
subdir=data

# Domains that are not so spammy
domains.whitelist

# Domains that contain lots of spamhosts
domains.blacklist
