Spamcalc feedback

Do you want to send feedback to the author?
First, all email with comments are welcome. My email address is
joost@carnique.nl.

To test the script, massive amounts of hostnames are used. If you have a big
list of hostnames and are willing to share them, please make a text file with
exactly 1 hostname per line (no trailing dots or anything) and email them to
joost@carnique.nl.

The data lists of the script are still very limited at the moment. More
spam words with spam scores are needed to make the script better.
In the data dir there is a file "words.template" which you can use to make
a complete word file for a language of which there is no word file yet. Or
you could make a list of additional words of an existing language.
Or, you could suggest changes in an existing word list.

The big question is how to score certain words. To be short: I don't know.
If a word has a very large chance of being spammy, I usually give it between
70 and 150 points. If it's just a 'small' spamword, I give it between 20
and 70 points.

Also, lists of domains with either a positive or negative spam value are 
are very welcome. Check the algorithms file to see what this means.
Please send them.

All feedback is welcome!
