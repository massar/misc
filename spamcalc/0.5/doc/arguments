Spamcalc command line arguments.

Last modified on 1 April 2002.

This file provides a list of available command line arguments and what they
do.

-b
Turns on bare output. This is very useful if you want to use the spam value
of a single hostname in other applications. Normally the output of the script
is something like "251 - who.is.your.daddy.com" but with the -b option the
output would just be "251".

-c <filename>
Sets the location of the configuration file. Usually this is the file
sc.conf in the same dir. If you don't specify the -c option, spamcalc will
look for sc.conf in the directory where it is located itself.

-d <value>
Sets the debug level so one can see exactly what the script is doing (or
failing to do). If the script is giving errors, set the debug value to 2 or
3 to better understand what's going on. Default value: 0.

-f <filename>
Read all the hostnames in this file and calculate their dnsspam value. The
file should consists of exactly 1 hostname per line and nothing else.

-v
Turns on the verbose mode. This will give a short report for each hostname that
has been calculated with the calculation used to obtain its spam value.

All other words on the command line are considered hostnames that need to be 
calculated. A list will be made of all the hostnames given in the command line
and/or in the file provided by the -f option and then calculated.
